Hooks let you run automated scripts at key moments during a Copilot agent session — when a session starts or ends, when the user submits a prompt, or before and after the agent uses a tool. They're the glue between Copilot's AI capabilities and your team's existing tooling: linters, formatters, governance scanners, and notification systems.

This article explains how hooks work, how to configure them, and practical patterns for common automation needs.

Recent [VS Code hook documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_hooks) clarifies that the agent hook harness supports the same lifecycle model, that `PreToolUse` hooks can block a tool call, and that enterprises can manage hook availability through policy. When sharing hook files across Copilot hosts, verify the host's supported events and policy settings before relying on a blocking hook.

## What Are Hooks?

Hooks are shell commands or scripts that run automatically in response to lifecycle events during a Copilot agent session. They execute outside the AI model, they're deterministic, repeatable, and under your full control.

**Key characteristics**:
- Hooks run as shell commands on the user's machine
- They execute synchronously—the agent waits for them to complete
- They can block actions (e.g., prevent commits that fail linting)
- They're defined in JSON files stored at `.github/hooks/*.json` in your repository
- They receive detailed context via JSON input, enabling context-aware automation
- They can include bundled scripts for complex logic

### When to Use Hooks vs Other Customizations

| Use Case | Best Tool |
|----------|-----------|
| Run a linter after every code change | **Hook** |
| Teach Copilot your coding standards | **Instruction** |
| Automate a multi-step workflow | **Skill** or **Agent** |
| Scan prompts for sensitive data | **Hook** |
| Format code before committing | **Hook** |
| Generate tests for new code | **Skill** |

Hooks are ideal for **deterministic automation** that must happen reliably—things you don't want to depend on the AI remembering to do.

## Anatomy of a Hook

Each hook in this repository is a folder containing:

```
hooks/
└── my-hook/
    ├── README.md          # Documentation with frontmatter
    ├── hooks.json         # Hook configuration
    └── scripts/           # Optional bundled scripts
        └── check.sh
```

> Note: Not all of these files are required for a generalised hook implementation. In your own repository, hooks are stored as JSON files in `.github/hooks/` (e.g., `.github/hooks/my-hook.json`). The folder structure above with README.md is specific to the Awesome Copilot repository for documentation purposes.


### hooks.json

The configuration defines which events trigger which commands:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "postToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "npx prettier --write .",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 30
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hook Events

Hooks can trigger on several lifecycle events:

| Event | When It Fires | Common Use Cases |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| `sessionStart` | Agent session begins or resumes | Initialize environments, log session starts, validate project state |
| `sessionEnd` | Agent session completes or is terminated | Clean up temp files, generate reports, send notifications |
| `userPromptSubmitted` | User submits a prompt | Log requests for auditing and compliance; handle requests directly without invoking the LLM (v1.0.44+); inject `additionalContext` into the model prompt (v1.0.65+) |
| `preToolUse` | Before the agent uses any tool (e.g., `bash`, `edit`) | **Approve or deny** tool executions, block dangerous commands, enforce security policies |
| `postToolUse` | After a tool **successfully** completes execution | Log results, track usage, format code after edits |
| `postToolUseFailure` | When a tool call **fails with an error** | Log errors for debugging, send failure alerts, track error patterns |
| `PermissionRequest` | When the CLI shows a **permission prompt** to the user | Programmatically approve or deny permission requests, enable auto-approval in CI/headless environments |
| `agentStop` | Main agent finishes responding to a prompt | Run final linters/formatters, validate complete changes |
| `preCompact` | Before the agent compacts its context window | Save a snapshot, log compaction event, run summary scripts |
| `subagentStart` | A subagent is spawned by the main agent | Inject additional context into the subagent's prompt, log subagent launches |
| `subagentStop` | A subagent completes before returning results | Audit subagent outputs, log subagent activity |
| `errorOccurred` | An error occurs during agent execution | Log errors for debugging, send notifications, track error patterns |

> **Key insight**: The `preToolUse` hook is the most powerful — it can **approve or deny** individual tool executions. This enables fine-grained security policies like blocking specific shell commands or requiring approval for sensitive file operations.

### sessionStart additionalContext

The `sessionStart` hook supports an `additionalContext` field in its output. When your hook script writes JSON to stdout containing an `additionalContext` key, that text is **injected directly into the conversation** at the start of the session. This lets hooks dynamically provide environment-specific context—such as the current git branch, deployment environment, or team onboarding notes—without requiring the user to paste it manually.

Example hook script that surfaces context:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output JSON with additionalContext to inject into the session
cat <<EOF
{
  "additionalContext": "Current branch: $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD). Open tickets: $(gh issue list --limit 3 --json number,title | jq -r '.[] | \"#\(.number) \(.title)\"' | tr '\n' '; ')"
}
EOF
```

### userPromptSubmitted additionalContext (v1.0.65+)

The `userPromptSubmitted` hook also supports the `additionalContext` field. When your hook returns `{"additionalContext": "..."}`, that text is **injected into the model-facing prompt** before the model processes the user's message. This is distinct from the `response` field (which bypasses the model entirely) — here the model still runs, but with extra context prepended.

This is useful for per-prompt enrichment: adding the current git diff, environment state, or dynamic instructions that should influence the model's response for this specific request.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Inject the current git status into every prompt for context awareness
INPUT=$(cat)
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
STAGED=$(git diff --cached --stat 2>/dev/null | tail -1)

cat <<EOF
{
  "additionalContext": "Active branch: $BRANCH. Staged changes: ${STAGED:-none}."
}
EOF
```

> **How it works**: If your hook writes `{"additionalContext": "..."}` to stdout and exits with code `0`, the text is prepended to the model prompt for this turn. The hook can also write both `additionalContext` and `response` — if `response` is present, that wins and the model call is skipped.

### Extension Hooks Merging

When multiple IDE extensions (or a mix of extensions and a `hooks.json` file) each define hooks, all hook definitions are **merged** rather than the last one overwriting the others. This means you can layer hooks from different sources—a project's `.github/hooks/` file, an extension you have installed, and a personal settings file—and all of them will fire for the relevant events.

### Cross-Platform Event Name Compatibility

Hook event names can be written in **camelCase** (e.g., `preToolUse`) or **PascalCase** (e.g., `PreToolUse`). Both are accepted, making hook configuration files compatible across GitHub Copilot CLI, VS Code, and Claude Code without modification. Hooks also support Claude Code's nested `matcher`/`hooks` structure alongside the standard flat format.

### Plugin Hooks Environment Variables

When hooks are defined inside a **plugin**, the hook scripts receive two additional environment variables automatically:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | The path to the current project (working) directory |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` | The path to a persistent data directory scoped to the plugin |

You can also use these as **template variables** directly in the `bash` or `powershell` fields of your `hooks.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "{{plugin_data_dir}}/scripts/init.sh --project {{project_dir}}",
        "timeoutSec": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This makes it straightforward to write plugin hooks that are portable across machines and projects without hardcoding paths.

### Event Configuration

Hooks support two types: `"command"` for running local shell scripts, and `"http"` for sending JSON payloads to a URL.

#### Shell command hooks (`type: "command"`)

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "bash": "./scripts/my-check.sh",
  "powershell": "./scripts/my-check.ps1",
  "matcher": "^bash$",
  "cwd": ".",
  "timeoutSec": 10,
  "env": {
    "CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
  }
}
```

**type**: `"command"` for shell-based hooks.

**bash**: The command or script to execute on Unix systems. Can be inline or reference a script file.

**powershell**: The command or script to execute on Windows systems. Either `bash` or `powershell` (or both) must be provided.

**matcher** *(optional)*: A regular expression matched against the tool name. When present, the hook only fires for tools whose name fully matches the regex. For example, `"^bash$"` ensures the hook only runs for the `bash` tool, not for `edit` or other tools. This is particularly useful for `preToolUse` and `postToolUse` hooks where you want to target a specific tool.

> **Important (v1.0.36+)**: Prior to v1.0.36, the `matcher` field was silently ignored — hooks with a `matcher` fired for all tool calls regardless of the regex. After upgrading to v1.0.36 or later, only tool calls whose name fully matches the `matcher` regex will trigger the hook. Review any existing `preToolUse`/`postToolUse` hooks that use `matcher` to ensure they still fire as expected.

> **Fix (v1.0.63+)**: A bug caused `postToolUse` matchers using pipe-separated patterns (e.g., `"matcher": "Edit|Write"`) to be silently dropped, so hooks targeting multiple tools were incorrectly firing for all tool calls. This is fixed in v1.0.63 — `postToolUse` matchers now work correctly. If you rely on a formatter or linter that runs after specific tools, upgrade to v1.0.63 or later to ensure it fires only when intended.

**cwd**: Working directory for the command (relative to repository root).

**timeoutSec**: Maximum execution time in seconds (default: 30). The hook is killed if it exceeds this limit.

**env**: Additional environment variables merged with the existing environment.

> **New (v1.0.81+)**: Hooks can now receive the current OpenTelemetry trace context so they can emit correlated spans. Hook inputs gain a `traceparent` field (plus `tracestate` when the span carries vendor-specific state); command hooks also receive these as environment variables, making it possible to link hook telemetry with the rest of a session's trace.

#### HTTP hooks (`type: "http"`)

Instead of running a local script, HTTP hooks POST a JSON payload to a configured URL. This is useful for integrating with webhooks, notification systems, or remote audit services — without needing a local script installed on every machine.

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://your-server.example.com/hooks/copilot",
  "timeoutSec": 10
}
```

The hook sends an HTTP POST request with the same JSON context that command hooks receive via stdin (tool name, tool input, session information, etc.). If the server responds with a non-2xx status, the hook is treated as failed.

**url**: The URL to POST the JSON payload to.

**timeoutSec**: Maximum time in seconds to wait for the HTTP response (default: 30).

HTTP hooks are a lightweight way to fan out hook events to centralized logging or governance services without distributing scripts to every developer's machine.

### README.md

The README provides metadata and documentation for the Awesome Copilot repository. While not required in your own implementation, it serves as a useful way to document them for your team.

```markdown

description: 'Automatically formats code using project formatters before commits'
tags: ['formatting', 'code-quality']
---

# Auto Format

Runs your project's configured formatter (Prettier, Black, gofmt, etc.)
automatically before the agent commits changes.

## Setup

1. Ensure your formatter is installed and configured
2. Copy the hooks.json to your `.github/hooks/` directory
3. Adjust the formatter command for your project
```

## Practical Examples

### Auto-Approve Permissions in CI with PermissionRequest

The `PermissionRequest` hook fires when the CLI shows a permission prompt to the user — for example, when the agent wants to run a shell command for the first time. Unlike `preToolUse` (which can block specific tool *calls*), `PermissionRequest` intercepts the permission approval UI itself, making it ideal for **headless and CI environments** where no one is available to click "Allow".

> **Location-based persistence (v1.0.37+)**: Permission approvals are now persisted by directory by default — once you approve a permission for a given working directory, that approval carries over to future sessions started in the same directory. You no longer need to re-approve the same tools every time. Use `PermissionRequest` hooks to automate approvals in CI, and rely on the persisted approvals for interactive local sessions.

When your hook script exits with code `0`, the permission request is **approved**. Exit with a non-zero code to **deny** it (the user will still see the prompt).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "PermissionRequest": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "./scripts/ci-permission-policy.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example policy script that auto-approves all permissions when running in CI:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/ci-permission-policy.sh
# Auto-approve all permission requests in CI environments
if [ "${CI}" = "true" ]; then
  exit 0   # approve
fi
exit 1     # deny (let the user decide interactively)
```

> **Security note**: Use `PermissionRequest` hooks carefully. Blanket auto-approval in non-CI environments removes an important safety check. Scope the auto-approval logic precisely (e.g., only in CI, only for specific tools).

> **Prompt mode security (v1.0.40+)**: When running the CLI in **prompt mode** (`copilot -p "..."`) — the non-interactive mode commonly used in CI pipelines — repo hooks are **disabled by default** for security. To opt in to repo hooks in prompt mode, set the environment variable `GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_REPO_HOOKS=true` before running the command:
> ```bash
> GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_REPO_HOOKS=true copilot -p "..." --no-ask-user
> ```
> This is a secure-by-default change: it prevents untrusted repository hooks from firing silently when a user runs a quick prompt command in an unfamiliar repository. Similarly, workspace MCP servers are disabled in prompt mode by default; opt in with `GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_WORKSPACE_MCP=true`. Extensions follow a mixed model (v1.0.41+): **user-level extensions** (from `~/.copilot/`) load automatically in prompt mode, but **project-level extensions and management tools** are disabled by default — opt in with `GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_EXTENSIONS=true` to load them.

### Handling Tool Failures with postToolUseFailure

The `postToolUseFailure` hook fires when a tool call fails with an error — distinct from `postToolUse`, which only fires on success. Use it to log errors, send failure alerts, or implement retry logic:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "postToolUseFailure": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "./scripts/notify-tool-failure.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook receives JSON input describing which tool failed and the error message. This separation lets you write targeted failure-handling logic without adding conditional checks to your `postToolUse` hooks.

> **Note**: Before v1.0.15, `postToolUse` fired for both successful and failed tool calls. If you have existing `postToolUse` hooks that handle failures, migrate that logic to `postToolUseFailure`.

### Auto-Format After Edits

Ensure all code is formatted after the agent edits files:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "postToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "npx prettier --write . && git add -A",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 30
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Lint Check When Agent Completes

Run ESLint after the agent finishes responding and block if there are errors:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "agentStop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "npx eslint . --max-warnings 0",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 60
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the lint command exits with a non-zero status, the action is blocked.

### Security Gating with preToolUse

Block dangerous commands before they execute. Use the `matcher` field to target only the `bash` tool, so the hook doesn't fire for file edits or other tools:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "matcher": "^bash$",
        "bash": "./scripts/security-check.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 15
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `preToolUse` hook receives JSON input with details about the tool being called. Your script can inspect this input and exit with a non-zero code to **deny** the tool execution, or exit with zero to **approve** it.

> **Exit code 2 — silent deny (v1.0.69+)**: A `preToolUse` hook that exits with code `2` **denies the tool call silently** — the agent receives a denial without any error message being surfaced to the user. This is useful when you want to block a tool call as a policy decision without triggering a noisy failure (for example, blocking network access in CI without alarming users). Exit with any other non-zero code (e.g., `1`) to deny and show an error message.

### Modifying Tool Arguments with preToolUse

Beyond approve/deny, `preToolUse` hooks can also **modify tool arguments** before they are passed to the tool, and inject **additional context** into the agent's reasoning. To do this, write JSON to stdout from your hook script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/sanitize-bash-args.sh
#
# Reads the proposed bash command from stdin, strips dangerous flags,
# and writes back the sanitized command as modifiedArgs.

INPUT=$(cat)
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

# Strip the --no-sandbox flag if present
SAFE_COMMAND=$(echo "$COMMAND" | sed 's/--no-sandbox//g')

echo "{\"modifiedArgs\": {\"command\": \"$SAFE_COMMAND\"}, \"additionalContext\": \"Command was sanitized by security policy.\"}"
```

The output fields are:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `modifiedArgs` (or `updatedInput`) | Replacement tool arguments. These are used instead of the originals. |
| `additionalContext` | Text injected into the agent's context for this turn — useful for explaining why a change was made. |

This enables sophisticated patterns like normalizing file paths, enforcing naming conventions, adding required flags, or surfacing policy context—without blocking the tool entirely.

> **Note**: Both `modifiedArgs` and `updatedInput` are accepted field names for the replacement arguments (for cross-tool compatibility).

### Governance Audit

Scan user prompts for potential security threats and log session activity:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": ".github/hooks/governance-audit/audit-session-start.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ],
    "userPromptSubmitted": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": ".github/hooks/governance-audit/audit-prompt.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "env": {
          "GOVERNANCE_LEVEL": "standard",
          "BLOCK_ON_THREAT": "false"
        },
        "timeoutSec": 10
      }
    ],
    "sessionEnd": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": ".github/hooks/governance-audit/audit-session-end.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This pattern is useful for enterprise environments that need to audit AI interactions for compliance.

### Handling Requests Directly with userPromptSubmitted (v1.0.44+)

Since v1.0.44, `userPromptSubmitted` hooks can do more than log or block — they can **handle a request entirely**, returning a response to the user without making any model call. When your hook script writes a JSON object with a `response` field to stdout, the CLI delivers that text to the user and skips the LLM altogether.

This is useful for:
- **FAQ bots**: Return canned answers for common questions without spending model quota
- **Policy enforcement**: Reject out-of-scope prompts with a clear, consistent message
- **Redirect patterns**: Direct users to a specific resource or runbook

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "userPromptSubmitted": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "./scripts/prompt-router.sh",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example script that handles a `/help` prefix without invoking the model:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/prompt-router.sh
# Return a direct response for known help queries — no LLM call needed.

INPUT=$(cat)
PROMPT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.prompt // empty' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if echo "$PROMPT" | grep -q "^/help\b"; then
  echo '{"response": "Available commands: /generate-tests, /review-pr, /explain-architecture. Type /help <command> for details."}'
  exit 0
fi

# No match — let the LLM handle it normally (exit 0 without writing a response)
exit 0
```

> **How it works**: When the hook exits with code `0` **and** writes a valid `{"response": "..."}` JSON object to stdout, the CLI delivers that text to the user and stops processing — no model call is made. If the hook exits with code `0` but writes nothing (or writes no `response` key), the CLI proceeds normally and calls the LLM.

> **Multiple hooks**: If several `userPromptSubmitted` hooks are configured, the first one that returns a `response` wins; subsequent hooks for that event are skipped.

### Notification on Session End

Send a Slack or Teams notification when an agent session completes:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionEnd": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "curl -X POST \"$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"text\": \"Copilot agent session completed\"}'",
        "cwd": ".",
        "env": {
          "SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL": "${input:slackWebhook}"
        },
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Notification on Session End via HTTP Hook

Send session activity to a remote audit endpoint using an HTTP hook (no local script needed):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionEnd": [
      {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://audit.example.com/copilot-sessions",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The CLI POSTs the session context as JSON to the specified URL. This is ideal for centralized logging or compliance services that should receive events from all developers without requiring each person to install a local script.

### Injecting Context into Subagents

The `subagentStart` hook fires when the main agent spawns a subagent (e.g., via the `task` tool). Use it to inject additional context—such as project conventions or security guidelines—directly into the subagent's prompt:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "subagentStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "echo 'Follow the team coding standards in .github/instructions/ for all code changes.'",
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is especially useful in multi-agent workflows where subagents may not automatically inherit context from the parent session.

### Plugin Hook Environment Variables

When hooks are defined inside a **plugin**, Copilot CLI automatically injects two extra environment variables so scripts can locate project-specific and plugin-specific directories:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | Absolute path to the working project directory |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` | Absolute path to the plugin's persistent data directory |

You can also reference these paths as template variables in your hook configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "postToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "{{plugin_data_dir}}/scripts/format.sh {{project_dir}}",
        "timeoutSec": 30
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This is useful for plugins that bundle scripts or data files alongside their hooks, since `{{plugin_data_dir}}` always points to the correct installed location regardless of where the plugin is installed.

## Writing Hook Scripts

For complex logic, use bundled scripts instead of inline bash commands:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
set -euo pipefail

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Format code
npx prettier --write .

# Run linter
npx eslint . --fix

# Run type checker
npx tsc --noEmit

# Stage any formatting changes
git add -A

echo "Pre-commit checks passed ✅"
```

**Tips for hook scripts**:
- Use `set -euo pipefail` to fail fast on errors
- Keep scripts focused—one responsibility per script
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`
- Test scripts manually before adding them to hooks.json
- Use reasonable timeouts—formatting a large codebase may need 30+ seconds

## Best Practices

- **Keep hooks fast**: Hooks run synchronously, so slow hooks delay the agent. Set tight timeouts and optimize scripts.
- **Use non-zero exit codes to block**: If a hook exits with a non-zero code, the triggering action is blocked. Use this for must-pass checks.
- **Bundle scripts in the hook folder**: Keep related scripts alongside the hooks.json for portability.
- **Document setup requirements**: If hooks depend on tools being installed (Prettier, ESLint), document this in the README.
- **Test locally first**: Run hook scripts manually before relying on them in agent sessions.
- **Layer hooks, don't overload**: Use multiple hook entries for independent checks rather than one monolithic script.

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I put hooks configuration files?**

A: There are several supported locations, loaded in order of precedence:

- **Repository-level** (shared with team): `.github/hooks/*.json` in your repository — all JSON files in this folder are loaded automatically
- **Claude/Copilot project settings**: `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` — hooks defined here are applied to the current repository without committing them to `.github/`
- **Global settings**: `settings.json` or `settings.local.json` (user-level CLI config)
- **Legacy config**: `config.json` (also supported)

For team-wide hooks that everyone should use, `.github/hooks/` is the recommended location as it is version-controlled and shared automatically.

**Q: Can hooks access the user's prompt text?**

A: Yes. For `userPromptSubmitted` events the prompt content is available via JSON input to the hook script. Since v1.0.44, these hooks can also **respond directly** by writing `{"response": "..."}` to stdout — the CLI delivers that text to the user and skips the LLM entirely. Other hooks like `preToolUse` and `postToolUse` receive context about the tool being called. See the [GitHub Copilot hooks documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-hooks) for details.

**Q: What happens if a hook times out?**

A: The hook is terminated and the agent continues. Set `timeoutSec` appropriately for your scripts.

**Q: Can I have multiple hooks for the same event?**

A: Yes. Hooks for the same event run in the order they appear in the array. If any hook fails (non-zero exit), subsequent hooks for that event may be skipped.

**Q: Do hooks work with the Copilot coding agent?**

A: Yes. Hooks are especially valuable with the coding agent because they provide deterministic guardrails for autonomous operations. See [Using the Copilot Coding Agent](../using-copilot-coding-agent/) for details.

## Next Steps

- **Build Agents**: [Building Custom Agents](../building-custom-agents/) — Create agents that complement hooks
- **Automate Further**: [Using the Copilot Coding Agent](../using-copilot-coding-agent/) — Run hooks in autonomous agent sessions
