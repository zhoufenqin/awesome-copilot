GitHub Copilot's built-in tools—code search, file editing, terminal access—cover a wide range of tasks. But real-world workflows often need access to external systems: databases, cloud APIs, monitoring dashboards, or internal services. That's where MCP servers come in.

This article explains what MCP is, how to configure servers, and how agents use them to accomplish tasks that would otherwise require context-switching.

## What Is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. An MCP server is a lightweight process that exposes capabilities—called **tools**—that Copilot can invoke during a conversation.

Think of MCP servers as bridges:

```
GitHub Copilot  ←→  MCP Server  ←→  External System
                     (bridge)        (database, API, etc.)
```

**Key characteristics**:
- MCP is an open protocol, not specific to GitHub Copilot—it works across AI tools
- Servers run locally on your machine or in a container
- Each server exposes one or more tools with defined inputs and outputs
- Agents and users can invoke MCP tools naturally during conversation

### Built-in vs MCP Tools

GitHub Copilot provides several **built-in tools** that are always available:

| Built-in Tool | What It Does |
|--------------|--------------|
| `codebase` | Search and analyze code across the repository |
| `terminal` | Run shell commands in the integrated terminal |
| `edit` | Create and modify files in the workspace |
| `fetch` | Make HTTP requests to URLs |
| `search` | Search across workspace files |
| `github` | Interact with GitHub APIs |

**MCP tools** extend this with external capabilities:

| MCP Server Example | What It Adds |
|-------------------|--------------|
| PostgreSQL server | Query databases, inspect schemas, analyze query plans |
| Docker server | Manage containers, inspect logs, deploy services |
| Sentry server | Fetch error reports, analyze crash data |
| Figma server | Read design tokens, component specs |

## Configuring MCP Servers

MCP servers are configured per-workspace. GitHub Copilot CLI discovers server definitions from several locations (loaded in order):

| File | Scope | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `.mcp.json` | Repository root | Preferred for repo-shared configuration |
| `.github/mcp.json` | Repository `.github/` folder | Auto-loaded workspace config (v1.0.61+) |
| `.vscode/mcp.json` | VS Code workspace | VS Code–compatible workspace config |
| `devcontainer.json` | Dev container | Available when running inside a container |

> **Security**: Workspace MCP servers are loaded **only after folder trust is confirmed**. If you haven't explicitly trusted a folder, servers defined in its config files won't start — protecting you from malicious MCP server configurations in untrusted repositories.

Example `.mcp.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
      }
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./docs"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Protocol update (v1.0.81+)**: GitHub Copilot CLI, the SDK, IDE integrations, and in-memory clients now support the **MCP 2026-07-28 specification**, keeping compatibility current with the latest Model Context Protocol servers as they adopt the new spec revision.

### Installing MCP Servers from the Registry

GitHub Copilot CLI provides a registry-based install flow that lets you browse and install MCP servers with guided configuration — no manual JSON editing required. In v1.0.64+, use the `/mcp registry` sub-command to browse available servers:

```
/mcp registry
```

A picker will list available servers from the registry. After selecting one, the CLI prompts for any required configuration values (connection strings, API keys, etc.) and writes the completed entry to your persistent MCP config automatically.

You can also install a specific server by name directly:

```
/mcp install @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
```

This guided flow is the recommended way to add new MCP servers, especially for servers that require multiple configuration values.

### Configuration Fields

**command**: The executable to run the MCP server (e.g., `npx`, `python`, `docker`).

**args**: Arguments passed to the command. Most MCP servers are distributed as npm packages and can be run with `npx -y`.

**env**: Environment variables passed to the server process. Use these for connection strings, API keys, and configuration—never hardcode secrets in the JSON file.

**type** (remote servers): The transport type for remote MCP servers (`http` or `sse`). This field can now be omitted — the CLI defaults to `http` when no type is specified, simplifying remote server configuration.

**deferTools** *(optional, v1.0.63+)*: When set to `false`, the server's tools are always available even when tool search is enabled. By default, tool search can hide rarely-used MCP tools to reduce context noise; setting `deferTools: false` on a server prevents its tools from being deferred, keeping them permanently in the tool list.

### Allowing MCP Server Instructions

By default, Copilot CLI limits which MCP server instructions are injected into the system prompt, to avoid noisy or unexpected instructions from servers you may not have fully reviewed. You can opt in to include instructions from **all** connected MCP servers with the `--allow-all-mcp-server-instructions` flag *(v1.0.66+)*:

```bash
copilot --allow-all-mcp-server-instructions
```

Use this only with servers you fully trust, since their instructions can influence how Copilot responds throughout the entire session. For most projects, the default behavior is sufficient — only enable this if a specific server requires it (for example, an internal tool whose instructions you control).

### Managing Persistent MCP Configuration via Server RPCs

In addition to file-based configuration, GitHub Copilot CLI exposes **server RPCs** that let MCP servers and tooling scripts manage the persistent MCP server registry at runtime. This enables programmatic setup — for example, an installer script that registers a server without requiring you to hand-edit a JSON file.

The available RPCs are:

| RPC | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `mcp.config.list` | List all currently registered persistent MCP servers |
| `mcp.config.add` | Add a new MCP server to the persistent configuration |
| `mcp.config.update` | Update an existing registered server |
| `mcp.config.remove` | Remove a server from the persistent configuration |

These are especially useful for plugins and installer scripts that need to self-register or de-register their MCP server as part of install/uninstall flows, without requiring the user to manually edit config files.

### Reading MCP Server Resources via Session RPCs

*(v1.0.70+)* In addition to config management, GitHub Copilot CLI exposes **paginated session RPCs** for reading resources exposed by connected MCP servers. These let agents and tooling access server-provided resource lists and templates without needing direct MCP protocol access:

| RPC | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `session.mcp.resources.read` | Read a specific resource from a connected MCP server |
| `session.mcp.resources.list` | List resources available on a connected MCP server (paginated) |
| `session.mcp.resources.listTemplates` | List resource templates exposed by a connected MCP server (paginated) |

Pagination support means these RPCs work reliably even when a server exposes a large number of resources. This is particularly useful for MCP servers that expose dynamic resource collections (such as database schemas or file trees) that need to be enumerated programmatically by agents or scripts.

### Common MCP Server Configurations

**PostgreSQL** — Query databases and inspect schemas:
```json
{
  "postgres": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"],
    "env": {
      "DATABASE_URL": "${input:databaseUrl}"
    }
  }
}
```

**GitHub** — Extended GitHub API access:
```json
{
  "github": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${input:githubToken}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Filesystem** — Controlled access to specific directories:
```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./data", "./config"]
  }
}
```

> **Security tip**: Use `${input:variableName}` for sensitive values. VS Code will prompt for these at runtime rather than storing them in the file.

### Authentication

Some MCP servers require authentication to connect to protected resources. GitHub Copilot CLI supports several authentication approaches:

- **OAuth**: MCP servers can use the OAuth flow to authenticate with external services. The CLI handles the browser redirect and token storage automatically. This also works when running in ACP (Agent Coordination Protocol) mode.
- **`client_credentials` grant type**: For fully headless environments where no browser is available and no user interaction is possible (such as server-to-server automation or CI pipelines), MCP servers can authenticate using the OAuth `client_credentials` grant type. This enables machine-to-machine authentication without any browser redirect or device code prompt.
- **Device code flow (RFC 8628)**: When the CLI runs in a **headless or CI environment** where a browser redirect is not possible, it automatically falls back to the device code flow. You'll see a URL and a code to enter on another device to complete authentication.
- **`/mcp auth`**: If a token expires or you need to switch accounts, run `/mcp auth` inside a session. This opens the re-authentication UI for any OAuth-enabled MCP server and supports account switching. You can re-authenticate without restarting the session.
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**: MCP servers that authenticate via Microsoft Entra ID are fully supported. Once you complete the initial login, the CLI caches the authentication and **will not show the consent screen on subsequent connections** — you authenticate once per session rather than every time the server reconnects.
- **API keys via environment variables**: Pass secrets through the `env` field in the MCP server configuration (see examples above). Never hardcode credentials in `.mcp.json`.
- **`${input:variableName}` prompts**: VS Code will prompt for these values at runtime, keeping secrets out of committed files.

> **Tip**: If your MCP server uses OAuth with Dynamic Client Registration but hosts its authorization metadata at a non-standard URL (as some enterprise servers like Atlassian Rovo do), Copilot CLI handles this automatically.

> **Client ID Metadata Document support (v1.0.83+)**: Copilot CLI can now sign in to MCP servers using a **Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)** for OAuth, an alternative to Dynamic Client Registration where the client's identity is published as a metadata document at a URL instead of being registered ahead of time with the authorization server.

## How Agents Use MCP Tools

When an agent declares an MCP server in its `tools` array, Copilot can invoke that server's capabilities during conversation:

```yaml
---
name: 'Database Administrator'
description: 'Expert DBA for PostgreSQL performance tuning and schema design'
tools: ['codebase', 'terminal', 'postgres']
---
```

With this configuration, the agent can:
- Run SQL queries to inspect table structures
- Analyze query execution plans
- Suggest index optimizations based on actual data
- Compare schema changes against the live database

### Example Conversation

```
User: The users page is loading slowly. Can you figure out why?

Agent: Let me check the query that powers the users page.
[Searches codebase for user listing query]
[Runs EXPLAIN ANALYZE via postgres MCP server]

I found the issue. The query on user_profiles is doing a sequential scan
on 2.4M rows. Here's what I recommend:

CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_active ON user_profiles (is_active)
  WHERE is_active = true;

This should reduce the query time from ~3.2s to ~15ms based on the
current data distribution.
```

Without the MCP server, the agent would have to guess at database structure and performance characteristics. With it, the agent works with real data.

### MCP operations in recent CLI releases

Copilot CLI 1.0.87 improved MCP reconnect and status reporting, making transient server failures easier to diagnose and recover from. It also added configurable warning thresholds for MCP-related conditions. Treat these as operational safeguards rather than a replacement for testing a server before relying on it:

1. Use the CLI's MCP status view to confirm whether a server is connected.
2. Read the reported warning or error before retrying a request.
3. Keep server startup, authentication, and recovery steps documented for the team.

See the [Copilot CLI 1.0.87 release notes](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.87) for the current behavior.

## MCP Sampling (LLM Inference Requests)

Some advanced MCP servers can request **LLM inference** from the Copilot model — a capability defined in the MCP specification as *sampling*. Instead of only receiving tool calls from the AI, these servers can ask Copilot to generate text or make decisions as part of their own logic.

**How it works**:
1. An MCP server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to Copilot.
2. Copilot shows a **review prompt** to the user, explaining what the server is requesting.
3. The user approves or rejects the request.
4. If approved, Copilot generates the response and returns it to the server.

This enables sophisticated patterns like MCP servers that orchestrate multi-step reasoning, generate structured output, or build more complex AI pipelines — while keeping the user in control with an explicit approval step.

> **Note**: Sampling requires explicit user approval every time a server requests inference. This is a security boundary — MCP servers cannot silently consume your AI quota or exfiltrate context without your knowledge.

## Finding MCP Servers

The MCP ecosystem is growing rapidly. Here are key resources:

- **[Official MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)**: Reference implementations for common services (PostgreSQL, Slack, Google Drive, etc.)
- **[MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/)**: The protocol specification for building your own servers
- **[Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)**: Community-curated list of MCP servers

### Building Your Own MCP Server

If your team has internal tools or proprietary APIs, you can build custom MCP servers. The protocol supports three main capability types:

| Capability | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Tools** | Functions the AI can invoke | `query_database`, `deploy_service` |
| **Resources** | Data the AI can read | Database schemas, API docs |
| **Prompts** | Pre-built conversation templates | Common troubleshooting flows |

MCP server SDKs are available in [Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), [TypeScript](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk), and other languages. Browse the [Agents Directory](../../agents/) for examples of agents built around MCP server expertise.

## Troubleshooting MCP Connection Issues

When an MCP server fails to start or loses its connection, Copilot CLI surfaces a warning with actionable details to help you diagnose the problem quickly.

**Failure warnings include stderr output** (v1.0.42+): If your MCP server prints error messages to stderr (e.g., missing environment variables, connection refused, import errors), those messages are now included directly in the CLI warning. This means you usually see the root cause without needing to run the server manually.

For example, a PostgreSQL server that can't connect because `DATABASE_URL` is not set will show:

```
⚠ MCP server "postgres" failed to start
  Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
  stderr: Error: DATABASE_URL environment variable is required
```

**Diagnosing connection problems with `/mcp show`**: Run `/mcp show` to see the current status of all configured MCP servers — which ones are running, which have failed, and their connection details. When an MCP server name contains whitespace, the failure warning also suggests a directly runnable `/mcp show <name>` command for quick inspection.

```
/mcp show              # list all servers and their status
/mcp show postgres     # inspect a specific server
```

**Viewing attached servers with `/mcp list`** (v1.0.69+): Use `/mcp list` to see which MCP servers are currently attached to your session and their status. Unlike `/mcp show` (which shows all configured servers), `/mcp list` focuses on what's active right now and can run **while the agent is working** — useful for checking server status mid-turn without interrupting the agent:

```
/mcp list              # show servers attached to this session
```

You can also open the `/mcp` manager while the agent is working to toggle servers on or off mid-turn. Add, edit, delete, and re-auth actions wait until the turn finishes, but enabling or disabling a server takes effect immediately.

**Toggling servers on and off** (v1.0.66+): From the `/mcp` list view, you can **enable or disable individual MCP servers** without editing your config file. Select a server in the list and toggle it — disabled servers won't start in future sessions and their tools won't be available to agents. This is useful for temporarily disabling a server that's causing slowdowns or errors without removing it from your configuration entirely.

**Common causes and fixes**:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `ENOENT` on startup | Missing `npx` / `python` / command | Verify the executable is installed and in your PATH |
| Auth errors / 401 | Expired or missing API key | Update the `env` field in your config; check `/mcp auth` |
| Server starts then exits | Server crash | Check stderr output in the warning for the root cause |
| Server blocked | Organization policy | Contact your admin; switch to an approved server |

## Best Practices

- **Principle of least privilege**: Only give MCP servers the minimum access they need. Use read-only database connections for analysis agents.
- **Keep secrets out of config files**: Use `${input:variableName}` for API keys and connection strings, or load from environment variables.
- **Document your servers**: Add comments or a README explaining which MCP servers your project uses and why.
- **Version control carefully**: Commit `.mcp.json` or `.vscode/mcp.json` for shared server configurations, but use `.gitignore` for any files containing credentials.
- **Test server connectivity**: Verify MCP servers start correctly before relying on them in agent workflows. Use `/mcp show` to check status and read stderr output in any failure warnings.
- **Use the MCP allowlist (experimental)**: In high-security environments, the `MCP_ALLOWLIST` feature flag lets you validate MCP servers against a configured registry, blocking unrecognized servers from loading. MCP servers that are blocked by the allowlist policy are **hidden from `/mcp show`** to avoid confusion — only permitted servers appear in that view. This is an experimental feature for enterprise environments requiring strict control over which MCP servers are permitted.

### Organization Policy for Third-Party MCP Servers

GitHub organizations can enforce a policy that restricts which third-party MCP servers members are permitted to use. When this policy is active:

- Copilot CLI **enforces** the policy for all users in the organization.
- A **warning is shown** if a configured MCP server is blocked by the policy, so you know which servers are restricted before expecting them to work.

If you see a warning that an MCP server is blocked, contact your organization administrator to find out which servers are on the allowlist, or switch to an approved alternative.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do MCP servers run in the cloud?**

A: No, MCP servers typically run locally on your machine as child processes. They're started automatically when needed and stopped when the session ends.

**Q: Can I use MCP servers without custom agents?**

A: Yes. Once configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`, MCP tools are available in any Copilot Chat session. Custom agents simply make it easier to pre-select the right tools for a workflow.

**Q: Are MCP servers secure?**

A: MCP servers run with the same permissions as your user account. Follow least-privilege principles: use read-only database connections, scope API tokens narrowly, and review server code before trusting it.

**Q: How many MCP servers can I configure?**

A: There's no hard limit, but each server is a running process. Configure only the servers you actively use. Most projects use 1–3 servers.

**Q: I'm using an Azure DevOps repository. Will the GitHub MCP server interfere?**

A: No. Copilot CLI automatically detects Azure DevOps repositories and disables the built-in GitHub MCP server for those sessions. This prevents irrelevant GitHub API calls when your project is hosted on Azure DevOps. Other MCP servers you have configured are unaffected.
